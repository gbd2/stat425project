**Abstract**
The National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) is an iconic component of American motorsports, drawing attention from fans, manufacturers, and teams alike. Weather conditions, however, can significantly affect race outcomes, from delaying or shortening events to influencing driver and manufacturer performance. This project examines the role of weather in NASCAR races using Bayesian statistical models. We analyze two key questions: (1) What is the probability of a NASCAR race being shortened due to specific weather conditions? (2) Are there manufacturers that consistently perform better under adverse weather conditions? Utilizing logistic regression, hierarchical linear modeling, and sensitivity analyses, we highlight precipitation as a major predictor of race outcomes. Although limited by data sparsity, our results demonstrate the utility of Bayesian methods in quantifying uncertainty and extracting insights from complex relationships between weather and race performance.
